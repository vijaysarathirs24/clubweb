## Hosting on GitHub Pages

3. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings:
   - Set the source to the `main` branch.
   - Set the folder to `/ (root)`.
4. Access the site at `https://your-username.github.io/student-platform`.

## Default Admin Account

## Notes

- File uploads are simulated by storing base64 data in `localStorage`.
- Passwords are stored in plain text for demo purposesâ€”do not use this in production with real user data.
